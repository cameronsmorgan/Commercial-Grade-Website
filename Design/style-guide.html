        <p><i>AC Milan is a prestigious football club, hailing from the fashionable streets of Milan. As such, the website needed to look classy while portraying the desired information in a legible and easy to understand format.</i></p>

        <h2 class="headings">Typography</h2>
        <p class="p-text">The primary font used is Sarabun. This is used for body text, certain headings and links. Visually, it is a clean and modern font that ensures readability across the website. The Dancing Script font is used for decorative text and headings. This is similar to a cursive font and combined with the stroke-dash animations has an effect that can be considered classy and elegant. </p>

        <h2>Colour Palette</h2>
        <p>Since their establishment, AC Milan's traditional colors have been red and black, thus it was appropriate to adopt a similar color palette for this website. The black is used primarily as background color and the red is used for hover and scroll effects. By utilizing these two colors, it creates a high-contrast and visually appealing design.</p>

        <h2>Graphics</h2>
        <p>Images of the San Siro, AC Milanâ€™s home stadium, greet the user on the landing page with a stroke-dash animation introducing the importance and history of the stadium in a single sentence. The stadium image, along with images of the players, are implemented with a parallax effect to create a smooth, visually engaging experience.</p>
