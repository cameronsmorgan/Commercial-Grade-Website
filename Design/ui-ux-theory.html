        <p>User experience is the study of the relationship between a person and a product. In order to have good design, we must holistically understand these 2 components.</p>

        <h2>The Person</h2>
        <p>To understand our user we must answer the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
           <li> Who is the target</li>
            <li>What kind of information are they looking for?</li>
            </ul>
            
            
        <p>In the context of our current project, we understand that we are building a football themed website. That precisely points us to our target – football fans, but football fans are fiercely loyal to their own, so the project is not for football fans as a whole but rather AC Milan fans, who seek information relating to AC Milan. By realizing this, we have created the Persona of an AC Milan fan. Personas are a great method of visualizing who your user’s will be and their thought processes when using your project. 
         </p>

        <h2>The product</h2>
        <p>An AC Milan themed website that showcases the prestige and stature of the club. As such the home page needs to be eye catching and so does the additional sections outside of the required Design and Theory sections. </p>

        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <p>75%of users believe they know if the page they are on is what they are looking for based only on the judgment they get from the first few seconds of browsing. User centred design is crucial to crafting a good experience. When designing the UI, I kept in mind the cognitive load of the user. A user is able to navigate from A to B and to C in minimal steps and keeping the website without clutter, therefore reducing the cognitive strain.
        User’s already know where they want to go and in most cases will have faint idea of how to even before exploring the website, given the number of websites they have visited in their life. As such there are certain practices that have become industry standard, such as keeping the navigation bar on the top. Adhering to these practices creates consistency and the user knows what to expect when they are on the landing page. I would like to improve my communication to the user as it is vital that they know what is happening after an action. Responsive design still needs to be touched up on to enable flexibility on multiple devices.
