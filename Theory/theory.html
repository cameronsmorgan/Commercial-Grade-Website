        </div>

        <p>AC Milan is a prestigious football club, hailing from the fashionable streets of Milan. As such, the website needed to look classy while portraying the desired information in a legible and easy to understand format.</p>

        <h2>Preparatory Work</h2>
        <p>A requirement of the data visualization is using live data from an API rather than locally stored data, therefore finding an API, reading the documentation and testing the different endpoints to see what data you could collect would be a good place to start. Once you know the data you can collect, you can plan the type of visualization you want to create. I regret not researching in depth different API’s I could use to enhance an AC Milan themed website as I struggled with this. I’ve tried multiple football related API’s such as FootyStats, Football-data.org, FootyAPI, TheSportsDB.com and each had their own issues such as providing insufficient data, only providing certain leagues in a free unpaid pricing plan or limiting the type of data you could scrape. In the end I landed on a SofaScoreAPI. SofaScore is an app that allows users to follow different leagues, teams, live matches and hold historical data from previous seasons.  </p>

        <h2>Collecting Data</h2>
        <p>When figuring out how to use and collect data from SofaScore, I landed on RapidAPI- an API hub that allows users to find, test and connect to millions of APIs. It was quite a useful tool as it provided examples of different endpoints and allowed you to test and view the data that would be collected. Even better, it provided code snippets to use when using Fetch and javascript. The only work I had to do was figure out the correct endpoints and ID’s to use for my visualization idea.</p>

        <h2>Data Visualization 1</h2>
        <p>My rational behind a data visualization is that it should enhance and portray AC Milan in a good light. There has been recently been some troubling times in the clubs history but the intention of this website is to portray the prestige and glory of the club. Therefore my initial idea was to have an animated bar graph and that displays the years of the club on the x-axis and number of trophies on the Y, with each bar broken into different color sections so that a hover tooltip could display what trophy was won and how many across the years but given that at this time I was using TheSportsDB.com API, they did not have the data recorded for AC Milans trophies. This was when I decided to explore other APIs and found SofaScore API and with it provided detailed historical data. So the initial idea was scrapped and seeing the data I could collect from SofaScore I created a bubble chart to display the 2022 league table when AC Milan won the league. It would showcase the narrative that followed that season and display how close and hard fought the championship was that season.</p>

        <h2>Data Visualization 2</h2>
        <p>For the second piece, I wanted to bring the user towards the present. On the SofaScore app, it gives each player a rating out of 10 and a colour associated with it. Green represents ratings above 7 which is a good performance, orange and yellow show an average performance and red is simply bad Given that AC Milan has had a decent start to the new season and the players are performing well I decided to make a heat map based on the player ratings and visualize the colours using the colour-rating scale of SofaScore.</p>
